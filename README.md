# ubuntu-server-admin

Scripts for setting up and managing Ubuntu servers over SSH (PuTTY, Terminal, etc), all from this one repo:

- **App server**: nginx, PHP and a menu-driven web account manager.
- **DB server**: MySQL, PostgreSQL and/or MariaDB, locked down to the app server.

## Setting up a new server

Connect to the new server in a terminal window and run:

```bash
sudo apt install -y git
sudo git clone https://github.com/igunter/ubuntu-server-admin.git /ubuntu-server-admin
cd /ubuntu-server-admin
sudo bash setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` asks what the server is for:

```
=========== Server Setup ===========
  1  App server   (nginx, PHP, Composer, web account manager)
  2  DB server    (MySQL, PostgreSQL and/or MariaDB)
  x  Exit
```

| Choice | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| App server | Runs `install.sh` (nginx, certbot, the shared folders and the "Site Unavailable" page), then offers the PHP stack (`appserver/install-php.sh`) and the "Hello" holding page (`appserver/install-holding.sh`), and finally starts the web account manager. |
| DB server | Runs `dbserver/install-db.sh`. You tick which engines to install (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB; MySQL and MariaDB can't share a server) and give the app server's private IP, and it creates a database and a user that can only connect from that IP. The generated passwords are shown once. |

Every script is safe to run again, and any of them can be run on its own, for example `sudo bash install.sh`.

A step-by-step guide to a two-server Laravel setup on Lightsail is in [`appserver/README.md`](appserver/README.md).

## Web Account Manager

Menu-driven management of nginx web accounts on the App server.

```
=========== Web Account Manager ===========
  1  List Accounts
  2  Create Account
  3  Edit Account        (change settings / delete account)
  4  Toggle Account Status
  5  Toggle SSL
  6  Add a Domain
  7  Remove a Domain
  x  Exit
```

Start it with:

```bash
cd /ubuntu-server-admin && sudo bash webadmin.sh
```

### Updating the scripts

```bash
cd /ubuntu-server-admin && sudo git pull && sudo bash webadmin.sh
```

A server cloned under the old repo name (`/ubuntu-app-server-admin`) keeps working, because GitHub redirects the old name. To switch it to the new one:

```bash
cd /ubuntu-app-server-admin && sudo git remote set-url origin https://github.com/igunter/ubuntu-server-admin.git
```

## What the options do

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| List Accounts | Shows every account with its status, SSL, PHP and domains. |
| Create Account | Creates `/var/www/<name>/public` with a "Coming Soon" placeholder `index.html`, and the nginx conf. |
| Edit Account | Change PHP on/off and max upload size, or delete the account (asks you to type the account name, and separately whether to delete the web files). |
| Toggle Account Status | When **off**, the site returns HTTP 503 and shows a "Site Unavailable" page on both HTTP and HTTPS. |
| Toggle SSL | Requests a Let's Encrypt certificate for all the account's domains and enables HTTPS with an HTTP redirect. Turning it off keeps the certificate. |
| Add a Domain | Adds a domain to an account (the certificate is expanded if SSL is on). |
| Remove a Domain | Removes a domain (the certificate is reissued if SSL is on). The last domain cannot be removed. |

## How it works

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Account settings (source of truth) | `/etc/webaccounts/<name>.env` |
| Generated nginx conf | `/etc/nginx/sites-available/<name>.conf`, symlinked into `sites-enabled/` |
| Web root | `/var/www/<name>/public` |
| Disabled-site page | `/var/www/_disabled/index.html` |
| Let's Encrypt challenges | `/var/www/_acme/` |

- Confs are regenerated from the settings file on every change, so **manual edits to the generated conf will be overwritten** - use the menu instead.
- Every change is checked with `nginx -t` before nginx is reloaded. If nginx rejects it, the previous conf is restored.
- For SSL, DNS for every domain on the account must already point at the server.
- For PHP accounts, install PHP-FPM first: `sudo apt install php-fpm`.
- The document root is the account's `public` folder, so a Laravel project can live in `/var/www/<name>` and use its own `public/` folder as is. nginx does not read `.htaccess` files.
- PHP accounts send unknown paths to `index.php` (the front controller Laravel needs); accounts without PHP return 404.
- Accounts created by older versions served `public_html`. It is renamed to `public` the next time that account's conf is rewritten (any change made from the menu), and an existing `public` folder is never overwritten.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu server with root/sudo access
- Ports 80 and 443 open

## PHP / Laravel and database servers

A full step-by-step guide to a two-server Laravel setup on Lightsail (App server + DB server, nginx, HTTPS, scheduler, queues, backups, deploys) is in [`appserver/README.md`](appserver/README.md). The PHP stack and holding page scripts are in [`appserver/`](appserver/) and the database installer is in [`dbserver/`](dbserver/).

### PostgreSQL point-in-time backups

On the DB server, after `setup.sh`: `sudo bash dbserver/install-backup.sh` sets up pgBackRest with WAL archiving to an encrypted S3 bucket in London, weekly full and daily differential backups, and an hourly monitor. How to restore and the test checklist are in [`dbserver/RESTORE.md`](dbserver/RESTORE.md), and the first test's results are in [`dbserver/restore-test-record.md`](dbserver/restore-test-record.md).

### PostgreSQL TLS

`sudo bash dbserver/enable-tls.sh` creates a private CA and server certificate and turns TLS on. `... enforce` then rejects unencrypted remote connections (do this only after the application uses the CA certificate with `verify-full`), `... check` shows the state, and `... summary` prints the non-secret details to give the application.
