# Restore test record (migration record)

No secrets in this file: no keys, passphrase or passwords.

## Summary

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Date of test | 2026-10-09 |
| Run by | Ian Gunter |
| Backup tool | pgBackRest 2.50, PostgreSQL 16 |
| Repository | S3 bucket `dbs-check-crm-backups`, region `eu-west-2` (London) |
| Encryption | pgBackRest `aes-256-cbc` (client-side) plus S3 server-side encryption |
| Base backup restored | `20261009-134714F` (full, taken 2026-10-09 14:47 UK time) |
| Source database size | 29.3 MB (3.6 MB in the repository) |
| Restore target | A separate scratch server (Ubuntu 24.04, London), built from nothing and given only the bucket name, a read-only access key and the passphrase. It was deleted afterwards. |

## Point-in-time results

Method: on the live DB server, a separate `restore_test` database was given 5 marked rows, which were then deleted. The database was then restored to a point just before the delete and to a point just after it.

| Restore target (UK time) | Expected | Actual |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-10-09 15:54:57.876558 +01 (rows present) | 5 rows | **5 rows** |
| 2026-10-09 15:55:02.969813 +01 (after delete) | 0 rows | **0 rows** |

## Time taken to restore

| Run | Base backup restore | Database ready (incl. WAL replay) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rows present | 5 s | 11 s |
| After delete | 5 s | 10 s |

These timings are for a 29 MB database and do not represent production. Re-time once real data is loaded, and add the time to build a server, deploy the application and repoint access.

## Notes on the test

- Earlier runs on the same day failed or gave the wrong count because the first version of the test script printed a timestamp that was not after the delete's commit. This was a fault in the test script, not in the backups. The script was fixed (it now writes a later commit and prints microseconds), and the passing runs above used the fixed script.
- The restored copy was started with archiving turned off and a read-only key, so it could not write to the live repository. No application was started against it, so no emails, DBS submissions or other external actions occurred.

## Monitoring and alerts

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Monitor | Hourly check at 7 minutes past (`pgbackrest-monitor`), plus weekly `pgbackrest verify` |
| Alert service | Healthchecks (period 1 hour, grace 30 minutes) |
| Failure alert tested | 2026-10-09 16:00: failure signal received |
| Alert recipients | **[to fill in: shared mailbox address and the named people it forwards to]** |

## Outstanding before cutover

- Written confirmation of encryption of the database server's disk (or data moved to an attached encrypted disk).
- TLS enforcement and verification details handed to the application (`dbserver/enable-tls.sh`).
- Outbound TCP 444 from the AppServer to the DBS host, and its observed outbound IP.
- Re-time the restore with production-sized data.
